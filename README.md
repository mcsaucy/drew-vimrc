vimrc
=====

My personal vim setup, consisting of vimrc files and a setup script.
The script will make a backup of your original .vimrc files that it might overwrite.

Installation
-----
If you trust me, here's a one-line installation:

    git clone git://github.com/mcsaucy/drew-vimrc.git ~/.drew-vimrc && ~/.drew-vimrc/setup_vimrc.sh
